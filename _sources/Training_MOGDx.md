# MOGDx Main Functions and Classes
We provide a description of the main functions and classes used to train a MOGDx model. 

## Graph Neural Network with Multi Modal Encoder (GNN-MME)
The GNN-MME is the main component in the architecture of MOGDx. It consists of a Multi-Modal Encoder (MME) to reduce the dimension of the input modalities and decodes all modalities to a shared latent space. 

Along with the MME there is a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Currently there are two GNN's implemented ; Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for applications in the transductive setting and GraphSage for applications in the inductive setting. Both algorithms are implemented using the Deep Graph Library ([DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/)).

### Multi Modal Encoder

### Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
GCN, developed by {cite:p}`kipf_semi-supervised_2017`, was implemented from the DGL. For a tutorial on the use of GCN's we refer you to the [DGL Tutorial Page](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/1.1.x/tutorials/blitz/1_introduction.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-blitz-1-introduction-py)

### GraphSage
GraphSage, developed by {cite:p}`hamilton_inductive_2017`, was implemented from the DGL. For a tutorial on the use of GraphSage we refer you to the [DGL Tutorial Page](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/tutorials/blitz/4_link_predict.html)
