    "## Graph Neural Network with Multi Modal Encoder (GNN-MME)\n",
    "The GNN-MME is the main component in the architecture of MOGDx. It consists of a Multi-Modal Encoder (MME) to reduce the dimension of the input modalities and decodes all modalities to a shared latent space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the MME there is a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Currently there are two GNN's implemented ; Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for applications in the transductive setting and GraphSage for applications in the inductive setting. Both algorithms are implemented using the Deep Graph Library ([DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/)). \n",
